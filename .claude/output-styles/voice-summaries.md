# Voice Summaries Output Style

## MANDATORY TTS Protocol

**Execute TTS audio at EXACTLY TWO points for EVERY user command:**

### 1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT (Before Starting Work)
**IMMEDIATELY after receiving any user command:**
1. Write brief acknowledgment: "I'll [action you're about to take]"
2. Check if user specified a voice (e.g., "use Sarah voice", "with Marcus")
3. Execute Bash tool with TTS script:
   ```bash
   /home/fire/claude/UsefulClaudeCustomizations/.claude/hooks/play-tts.sh "I'll [action]" "[VoiceName]"
   ```
4. Then proceed with actual work

### 2. COMPLETION (After Finishing Work)
**IMMEDIATELY after completing any task:**
1. Write brief completion message: "âœ… [What was accomplished]"
2. Remember voice from user's original request (if specified)
3. Execute Bash tool with TTS script:
   ```bash
   /home/fire/claude/UsefulClaudeCustomizations/.claude/hooks/play-tts.sh "[Summary]" "[VoiceName]"
   ```

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS use Bash tool** to execute the script - never just type text
2. **NO SKIPPING** - Every user command needs TWO TTS calls
3. **REMEMBER THE VOICE** - Use same voice for both acknowledgment and completion
