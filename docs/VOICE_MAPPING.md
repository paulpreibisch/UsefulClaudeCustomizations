# üé≠ Terminal Session Voice Mapping

Each Terminal Keeper session now has its own unique voice for easy audio identification!

## üé§ How Dynamic Voice Assignment Works

The hook **automatically reads your `.vscode/sessions.json`** file and assigns voices to sessions dynamically:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Reads current Terminal Keeper sessions from `.vscode/sessions.json`
2. **Dynamic Assignment**: Assigns voices to sessions in order (first session gets first voice, etc.)
3. **Consistent Mapping**: The same session always gets the same voice (as long as session order doesn't change)
4. **Adaptive**: Automatically handles new sessions or session changes

## üéØ Example Voice Assignment

If your `.vscode/sessions.json` contains these sessions:
```json
{
  "active": "default",
  "sessions": {
    "default": [
      {"name": "SageDev 1", "cwd": "..."},
      {"name": "SageDev 2", "cwd": "..."},
      {"name": "WSL SageDev", "cwd": "..."},
      {"name": "TypeScript", "cwd": "..."},
      {"name": "Frontend", "cwd": "..."}
    ]
  }
}
```

The voices will be assigned automatically:
- **SageDev 1** ‚Üí Voice 1 (`zYcjlYFOd3taleS0gkk3`)
- **SageDev 2** ‚Üí Voice 2 (`ruirxsoakN0GWmGNIo04`)
- **WSL SageDev** ‚Üí Voice 3 (`DGzg6RaUqxGRTHSBjfgF`)
- **TypeScript** ‚Üí Voice 4 (`vfaqCOvlrKi4Zp7C2IAm`)
- **Frontend** ‚Üí Voice 5 (`KTPVrSVAEUSJRClDzBw7`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

The example voice IDs provided are custom/personal voices from an ElevenLabs account. They may not be available in the public voice library, which means:

1. **Personal Use**: These voices are likely from a personal ElevenLabs account
2. **Custom Voices**: They might be voice clones or premium voices
3. **Account Specific**: Other users will need to replace these with their own voice IDs

## üîß For Other Users

Replace the voice IDs in the `availableVoiceIds` array with your own ElevenLabs voice IDs:

```typescript
availableVoiceIds: [
  'your-voice-id-1',  // Will be assigned to first session
  'your-voice-id-2',  // Will be assigned to second session
  'your-voice-id-3',  // Will be assigned to third session
  // ... add more voice IDs as needed
]
```

## üîä How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: Hook reads `.vscode/sessions.json` to identify your current session
2. **Voice Mapping**: Each session gets its unique voice that stays consistent
3. **Audio Identification**: You'll instantly know which session completed a task by the voice

## üéØ Example Outputs

- **SageDev 1**: Your custom voice says *"Session SageDev 1: Created test file successfully"*
- **SageDev 2**: Rachel says *"Session SageDev 2: Updated configuration settings"*
- **WSL SageDev**: George says *"Session WSL SageDev: Fixed authentication bug"*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Add New Sessions
Edit the `sessionVoices` mapping in `hooks/stop-elevenlabs.ts`:

```typescript
sessionVoices: {
  'Your New Session': 'voice-id-here',  // Add your session
  // ... existing mappings
}
```

### Change Voice for Existing Session
Simply update the voice ID in the mapping and restart Claude Code.

### Manual Override
```bash
export CLAUDE_SESSION_NAME="TypeScript"
# Now all tasks will use Daniel's British accent
```
