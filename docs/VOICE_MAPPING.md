| **SageDev 1** | Custom | Your selected voice | `yOsUZuYik0dKCynjfgaE` |
| **SageDev 2** | Rachel | Professional newsreader (female) | `EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL` |

## üîä How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: Hook reads `.vscode/sessions.json` to identify your current session
2. **Voice Mapping**: Each session gets its unique voice that stays consistent
3. **Audio Identification**: You'll instantly know which session completed a task by the voice

## üéØ Example Outputs

- **SageDev 1**: Your custom voice says *"Session SageDev 1: Created test file successfully"*
- **SageDev 2**: Rachel says *"Session SageDev 2: Updated configuration settings"*
- **WSL SageDev**: George says *"Session WSL SageDev: Fixed authentication bug"*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Add New Sessions
Edit the `sessionVoices` mapping in `hooks/stop-elevenlabs.ts`:

```typescript
sessionVoices: {
  'Your New Session': 'voice-id-here',  // Add your session
  // ... existing mappings
}
```

### Change Voice for Existing Session
Simply update the voice ID in the mapping and restart Claude Code.

### Manual Override
```bash
export CLAUDE_SESSION_NAME="TypeScript"
# Now all tasks will use Daniel's British accent
```
